Inverse kinematics is a mathematical concept in the domain of robotics which is used to calculate joint angles of the robot given the end effector has to be moved to a specific point in space.

PyBullet physics simulation engine has been used to load the two robotic hands. Forward kinematics is used to set hand 1 in an orientaion and inverse kinematics is implemented to make hand 2 imitate hand 1.
